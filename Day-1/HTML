HTML means Hypertext Markup Language.
   -That gives structure,formatting,actual visual for website //Note:note Colors,Styles.
   -HTML is not case sensitive language i.e we can write upper case and lower case in HTML.
    Eg.<HEAD> <head> // this means same.

Here we will be learning about HTML 5

In HTMl we use tags:
    Tags are the components used to design the structure of websites.
    Tags are of 2 types:
              1.Pair tag
                       - Tags having both opening and closing tag.
              2.Single tag  
                       -Tags having only opening tag.

The standard elements that browser recognizes are:
         1.Paragraph element 
         2.Heading element 
         3.Image element
1.Paragraph element:
             This represents paragraphs in program. Single tag will display single paragraph or single line.
              If we want to change paragraph or change line we must use different tag.
                          <p> //body </p>
                 Eg:
                   <p> This is my very first paragraph using paragraph tag.</p>
               This will display:
                     This is my very first paragraph using paragraph tag.
2.Heading element:
            This represents headings in program. If we want some thing to be heading of our project then we use heading tag.
            It has 6 levels  h1,h2...h6. h1 means biggest in size and h6 means smallest. 
                          <h> //body </h>
                  Eg:
                      <h1>This is the heading<h1>

we will learn about image element the next day.
