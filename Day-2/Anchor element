Anchor Element:
      This is used to while adding links to your page. Also there are 2 types of links we should know before hand.
          1.Absolute Link:
              -Directly extracted from internet like https://www.google.com or https://www.facebook.com
      
          2.Relative link:
              -Those link that we create from our own files where as that link has to be in same file our program is.

     <a>//body </a> this is the tag for anchor element. Here we will look at small example:

      <!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
    <head>
        <meta charset="UTF-8">
        <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
        <title>Anchor Tag In HTML></title>
    </head>
    <body>                
         <p><a href="https://www.google.com/">Google</a></p>    // these are absolute links
         <p><a href="https://www.netflix.com/">Netflix</a></p>
    </body>
</html>
 
Here,
    href means Hypertext Reference.Inside href we have to write whole link.
    And the second half of anchor tag >Google</a> will display as Google and
    if we click on Google that will take us to the google page.
