Image Element:
      -Used to add images to our page.
      -A single tag <img>.
      -Has 2 attributes inside it:
                 1.Source attribute:
                         Here we write the link of what needs to displayed. Which again can be both alsolute and relative link.
                         If we use absolute link, the content of internet might get deleted and that will effect our program too unlike relative link.
                            Eg:<img src="link either copied from internet or made by us( but has to be of same name we used to save)."
                 2.Alternate attribute:
                         Here we write what is in the image.This is important because when the internet is down
                         and is slow the image doesnot load so to let the viewr know what was in the image.
                            Eg: alt="Random image">.

       - A small eg of image element is:
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
    <head>
        <meta charset="UTF-8">
        <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
        <title>Image element in HTML</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <img src="https://cdn.britannica.com/49/182849-050-4C7FE34F/scene-Iron-Man.jpg" height="100" width="100" alt="iron image">
    </body>
</html>

 The height and width are used to set the size of image.
